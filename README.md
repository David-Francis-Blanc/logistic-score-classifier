# Logistic Regression: Predicting Pass/Fail from Study Hours

This project uses a simple logistic regression model to predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on how many hours they study.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Takes labeled data: hours studied (X) and pass/fail outcome (y)
- Trains a logistic regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Predicts pass/fail for new inputs
- Outputs confidence levels for predictions

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
